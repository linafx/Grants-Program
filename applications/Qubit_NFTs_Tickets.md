# Open Grant Proposal

  * **Project Name:** Qubit NFTs Tickets
  * **Team Name:**  Qubit Labs
  * **Payment Address:** USDT (TRC20) TPg1AZ4ENbPpvSkuPycrEe9G7pC99cN94m
  * **Status:**: Level 2 üê§

### Overview
  * Qubit is a Multi-chain NFT ticketing marketplace build on Polkadot, which is a way to disrupt the traditional model. A game theory system applied to NFT ticketing maintains its equilibrium.
  * Qubit is a cross-chain NFTs ticketing marketplace build on Polkadot technologies. It allows you to transfer and create your NFTs from any chain (currently planned support: BSC, ETH, AVAX, Polkadot, Kusama, Flare Network) into Qubit. Enjoy low fees transactions and fast transfers. Buy / Sell NFTs tickets in our marketplace, or just create your own to sell or pool and earn the reward. It‚Äôs time to use blockchain technologies for real-world usage and modernize the legacy ticketing flow to migrate ticket identity.
  * Since 2018 we founded Qubit and we did it with the mission of finding true use cases for Blockchain technology and being in some way ambassadors in LATAM. Since then we have been working full time on this dream and fortunately, we found in NFT Ticketing more practical use cases than investing in digital art.

### Project Details 

  ***Introduction***
  
   * The digital divide began several years ago and the world is gradually becoming digitalized. The majority of payments are now made online and more and more digital products are being purchased. However, ownership of these goods rarely belongs to the buyers. The digital tickets that you have on your Apple wallet or QR Code in PDF or others platforms do not really belong to you. The advent of NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) has revolutionized digital goods and allows for true ownership within the blockchain. The NFTs belong to you and you are free to dispose of them as you want. However, the sale, purchase or exchange of NFTs ticketing is unfortunately not available to everyone yet. Between the difficulty of using the various marketplace and the increasing cost of gas fees, NFTs have become reserved for the medium and large wallet. With the arrival of utility NFTs (in tickets for example) it has become crucial to transform the way we exchange NFTs to make them easily accessible to everyone, both in terms of usage and associated costs.
    
   *Qubit was born out of this observation. An ecosystem modernizes the legacy ticketing flow to migrate ticket identity from static QR codes to a secured, digital-only representation by creating an NFT platform based on Polkadot and the framework substrate. The development of Qubit is based on several essential components (frameworks):

### Frameworks

  ***The Factory***
  
  Making the creation and deployment of NFTs Tickets simple, fast and accessible to artists, content creators, event organizers, or anyone else.

  ***The Hub***
  
  Allow the interconnection of NFTs between different chains, whether it is to The Binance Chain, Ethereum, Avax, Polkadot or Flare, the goal of the Hub is to make the cross-chain transition simple and accessible.
  
  ***The Market***
  
  Real main component of the ecosystem, the market allows the sale, purchase or exchange of NFTs Tickets, whether by auction or simple listing. Users also have the possibility to exchange NFTs directly. Finally, thanks to DeFi, the market allows NFTs to be borrowed and lent and financing events.
  
  ***The Reselling***
  
  The domain of Sharding. This is the place where the magic happens and allows allow for the purchase, transfer, resale (but you continue to make royalty money on them), or even refund of an event ticket.
  
  ***The Vault***
  
  Allows you to place your NFTs as collateral in order to retrieve tokens or financing next events.
  
  ***The Home***
  
  A dashboard to manage your NFTs.
  
  ***Governance and Treasury***
  
  Qubit is based on the substrate framework, so it benefits from a truly decentralized governance system built directly within the blockchain itself. Among other things, it allows any $QNFT holder to have a voice in the evolution of the ecosystem. Through governance, it is possible to submit proposals to help Qubit evolve, submit bounty to direct the development of different products, or even offer tips to reward the work done by the community.
  The technical committee ensures the stability and safety of the blockchain. They are therefore able to submit emergency motions to council, once validated by the council, these motions apply in a shorter time frame than the classic motions. This chamber is reserved for members with an excellent knowledge of the blockchain and the Qubit source code.
  
  Council members vote on motions and expenditures of the treasury (mission / tip). Their role is central and their mission is to make the ecosystem evolve by validating the proposals made by the community. They are elected by the community and their mandate currently lasts 7 days. The seats on the council are open and any $QNFT holder can submit his candidacy.
  
  Holders of $QNFT can vote to elect council members, make proposals to improve the blockchain, propose missions or carry out missions. They are the heart of Qubit and it is thanks to them that the ecosystem evolves and moves forward.
  
  It is thanks to this governance system that Qubit users can have a strong impact in the evolution of the ecosystem. It is no longer a single entity that has the power, but the entire community. In order to support the different evolutions of the blockchain, the treasury is a crucial mechanism allowing Qubit to support itself without the help of a third party. It essentially allows the community to be able to set up remunerated missions to develop new products, do marketing, add new bridges or any other proposal deemed relevant by the members of the board and validated by the community.

###Ecosystem Fit

   * Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?: NFTs Market
   * Who is your target audience: parachain, own user base, some dapp's userbase
   * Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?: No
   * Are there similar projects in related ecosystems?: Yes, in Ethereum and DAO

 *Key Insight*
 
   * Before creating Qubit, we believed that event organizers did not like to resell, now we know something as simple as that if they like to resell, what they don't like is not participating in the royalties that this generates.
   * Qubit NFT ticketing is a golden opportunity to disrupt the conventional ticketing model. This could be advantageous for an event organizer to receive a payment every time someone sells a ticket. Preserving the security parameters, being able to maintain the user experience and shortly convert those NFTs collectible and interchangeable tickets.
   * Qubit NFT tickets have a use case that is not as subjective (like digital art), making this concept a mass-market winner

  *Collaboration and Balance*
  
  Although many of us do not like reselling, we have understood that this is a fundamental part of the ticketing ecosystem. That is why we are fighting unauthorized resale with the help of event organizers, through a balanced sales system, in which resale does not disappear and sellers are identified with a code that allows us to trace the ticket and with this allow the organizer of the event, at any given time, to continue receiving benefits from that same ticket.
